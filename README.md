# Sentiment-Analysis

English Sentiment Analysis Project
Description
This project is a sentiment analysis system that classifies English text reviews as positive or negative. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to understand the sentiment behind movie reviews. The main goal is to build a predictive model that can automatically analyze textual data and provide insights into users’ opinions.
Features
• Text Preprocessing: Cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization of text data.
• Machine Learning Models: Classification using Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes.
• Evaluation & Visualization: Accuracy scores, confusion matrix, and graphical representations of results.
• Scalable: Can be extended to other datasets or real-world applications.
Dataset
The model is trained on IMDb movie reviews, providing a solid benchmark for sentiment classification.
Usage
Users can input any English text review, and the system predicts whether the sentiment is positive or negative.
Future Improvements
• Incorporate advanced deep learning models like LSTM or BERT.
• Expand to multiple data sources such as Twitter, YouTube comments, or product reviews.
• Enhance visualization with interactive dashboards for better insights.
Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in NLP, machine learning, data preprocessing, model evaluation, and visualization. It also strengthened my problem-solving and coding skills in Python, preparing me for more complex AI and data science projects.
